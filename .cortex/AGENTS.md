# Nook Agent Map (Table of Contents)

This is the system of record and entry point for all AI agents working in this repository. Follow the links below for deep context on Nook's architecture, design, and standards.

## ⛔ Non-negotiable: squash merge every PR

**All pull requests merged into `main` MUST be squash-merged** (GitHub: **Squash and merge**; CLI: `gh pr merge --squash`). One PR = one commit on `main`. Merge commits and rebase merges are **forbidden**. Full policy: [rules.md §6](rules.md#6-git--pull-request-workflow).

## ⛔ Non-negotiable: never kill the Docker daemon

**Killing the Docker daemon is strictly prohibited.** Only individual **Docker containers** may be stopped — never Docker Desktop, `dockerd`, or the Docker VM.

- **Forbidden:** `killall Docker`, `killall docker`, `pkill docker`, `pkill -f docker`, `osascript` quit Docker, `systemctl stop docker`, or any command aimed at the daemon or Desktop app.
- **Forbidden:** `lsof -ti :<port> | xargs kill` when that port is forwarded by Docker (e.g. `:5173` for `task web:dev`) — use `docker ps` → `docker stop <container>` instead.
- **Allowed:** `docker stop <container_id>`, `docker rm`, `docker compose down` for a specific stack.

Full policy: [rules.md §5](rules.md#docker-daemon--never-kill-it).
